## orchy-storage-plugin

This plugin allows you to store your data inside the `local` or `session` storage using the `orchy's eventBus`.

### Plugin configuration

The plugin accepts one attribute:

The plugin accepts one property:
- `eventBus`: the `orchy's eventBus` instance.

### EventBus messages

#### Retrieve data
